# 2fit

2fit is an Android App, written in Java, that aims to help users find motivation for exercise by sharing their achievments with others. Users will also be able to contact other users with similar interests and demographics to meet up for exercise. The app utilizes a Firebase backend.

2fit aims to appeal to broad and diverse audience, from amateurs all the way to fitness enthusiasts and seasoned athletes. We believe that exercise shouldn't be viewed as a chore or as a item to check off the daily list; instead, it should be a time of recreation and having fun.

#Progress

Currently, 2fit is still in the development stage. After making a few more minor improvements to facilitate post uploads, we will start implementing the algorithm to pair up similar users.
